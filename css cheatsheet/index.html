            <p>He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the
                choice
                so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been
                fine
                if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.</p>

            <p>The light was out on the front porch of the house. This was strange. Judy couldn't remember a time when
                she
                had ever seen it out. She hopped out of her car and walked to the door. It was slightly ajar and she
                knew
                this meant something terrible. She gently pushed the door open and hall her fears were realized.
                "Surprise!
                Happy Birthday!" everyone shouted.

            <h3>The Question</h3>
            <p>She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she'd know that he wasn't who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer.

            <h3>Matt</h3>
            <p>Matt told her to reach for the stars, but Veronica thought it was the most ridiculous advice she'd ever received. Sure, it had been well-meaning when he said it, but she didn't understand why anyone would want to suggest something that would literally kill you if you actually managed to achieve it.

Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue.
