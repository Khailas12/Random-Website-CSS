                <p>I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival
                    there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the
                    birthday
                    if possible. I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment schedule and my flight plans.

                but couldn't make out exactly what the yelling was about.</p>
